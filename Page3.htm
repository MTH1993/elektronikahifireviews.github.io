<p> “The Sony TC-756 set
  new records for performance
  of home tape decks.’
  (Stereo Review, February, 1975)
  Hirsch-Houck Laboratories further
  noted, “The dynamic range, distortion,
  flutter and frequency-response per-
  formance are so far beyond the limita-
  tions of conventional program material
  that its virtues can hardly be
  appreciated!’
  The Sony TC-756-2 features a
  closed loop dual capstan tape drive
  system that reduces wow and flutter
  to aminimum of 0.03%, logic controlled
  transport functions that permit the
  feather-touch control buttons to be
  operated in any sequence, at any time
  without spilling or damaging tape; an
  AC servo control capstan motor
  and an eight-pole induction motor for
  each of the two reels; a record equal-
  ization selector switch for maximum
  record and playback characteristics with
  either normal or special tapes; mic
  attenuators that eliminate distor-
  tion caused by overdriving the micro-
  phone pre-amplifier stage when using
  sensitive condenser mics: tape/source
  monitoring switches that allow instan-
  taneous comparison of program source
  to the actual recording; a mechanical
  memory capability that allows the
  machine to turn itself on and off auto-
  matically for unattended recording.
  In addition, the TC-756-2 offers 15
  and 7% ips tape speeds; Ferrite &
  Ferrite 2-track/2-channel stereo
  three-head configuration; and symphase
  recording that allows you to record FM
  matrix or SQ* 4-channel sources for
  playback through a decoder-equipped
  4-channel amplifier with virtually non-
  existent phase differences between
  channels.
  The Sony TC-756-2 is represent-
  ative of the prestigious Sony 700 Series
  —the five best three-motor 10%-inch
  reel home tape decks that Sony has
  ever engineered. </p>
